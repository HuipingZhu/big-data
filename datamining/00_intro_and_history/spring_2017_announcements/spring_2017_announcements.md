## Section 00 Announcements

1. Attend class **if possible**:
  * In general, you only need to attend the class (e.g. Thursday or Friday) you registered for, **not both classes**.
  * As of now Thursday's class (1/19) is still on schedule.
  * Friday's class (1/20) is **cancelled** because the university is closed (as some of you correctly pointed out).
  * Neither section's classroom is capable of video recordings.
  * I intend to teach the same material for both classes.

2. Read the class [syllabus](https://github.com/jphall663/GWU_data_mining/blob/master/README.md).

3. Study all the class notes and required reading materials listed on the [Section 00 page](https://github.com/jphall663/GWU_data_mining/blob/master/00_intro_and_history/00_intro_and_history.md) in preparation for a quiz the following week (1/26-1/27). You should also have a look at the [sample quiz](https://github.com/jphall663/GWU_data_mining/blob/master/00_intro_and_history/sample_quiz/quiz_0.pdf). The *Advanced Business Analytics* materials have been posted to the Electronic Reserves section of Blackboard.

4. Pick your group for the semester project. Please speak with your classmates about which group you will be joining and either send a representative from your group to Thursday's class or contact me about your group members by email (one email per group please, and include your section number: Thursday=11, Friday=12).

5. Begin installing software over the next few weeks:
  * Register for [SAS on Demand for Academics](https://odamid.oda.sas.com/SASODAControlCenter/enroll.html?enroll=f0c0602b-d3c3-4676-b44c-c378f14fac91) which will give you access to cloud versions of SAS software suitable for in class use.
  * You may need a local install of SAS to complete some assignments and you may need to contact the [GWU Instructional Technology Lab](https://itl.gwu.edu/sas-software-distribution) for information or assistance regarding installing this software. I would try to start installing SAS and SAS Enterprise Miner soon.
  * For Python and h2o.ai:
    * First, install [Anaconda Python](https://www.continuum.io/downloads).
    * Then install the [h2o.ai library for Python](http://h2o-release.s3.amazonaws.com/h2o/rel-tutte/2/index.html). (See the 'INSTALL IN PYTHON' tab **only**).
  * If you are have difficulties with installing software, we can discuss them in class or office hours.
